# wM-Bus Example Research

## Overview
This document should contain research about wireless Modbus (wM-Bus) communication examples and implementation details. However, the example files appear to be missing from the repository.

## Expected wM-Bus Core Elements
Based on the project name and standard wM-Bus implementations, the following elements would typically be present:

### Protocol Frame Structure
- Frame synchronization
- Data link layer addressing
- Security modes and encryption
- Application layer data

### 3-of-6 Decoding Algorithm
- Binary to 3-of-6 conversion
- Error detection capabilities
- Data integrity verification

### Communication Modes
- Mode T (Meter reading - unidirectional)
- Mode S (System meter reading - bidirectional)
- Mode C (Configurational)
- Mode N (Meter reading - unidirectional, narrow band)

## Expected CC1101 Integration
- RF configuration for wM-Bus frequencies
- Packet handling for wM-Bus frames
- Communication timing and protocols

## Note
The actual example files are missing from this repository, so this document is based on expected wM-Bus implementation patterns.
